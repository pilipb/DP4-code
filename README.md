# Engineering Design Penultimate Year Research and Dissertation Project

### Outline
The aim of this project is to produce production standard code for the modelling, optimisation and prediction of power output for the Pico Stream hydro-power turbine.

### Aims
The development of the model will build on the existing Pico Stream model and incorporate details from the research. The main objectives of this stage of the project will lie in developing a model that is flexible to variable conditions.

The model will allow variable flow condition inputs, including variable head and flow rate/volume.

The model will then be developed to be used in both the breast shot and under shot flow configurations with the same parameters as in (A).

The model will also be developed to allow the positioning of the turbine to be varied in respect to a datum set by the river position in the given configuration.
